[01:24.70] Designer crimes, or it wouldn't be me, ooh!
[01:27.39] Diamonds shining, drive in silence, I don't mind it, I'm riding
[01:30.46] Flying private side by side with the pilot up in the sky
[01:33.04] And I'm wyling, styling on them and there's no chance
[01:35.59] 'Cause we got bodies on bodies like this a slow dance
