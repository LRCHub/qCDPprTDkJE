[00:07.85] Blackpink
[00:10.48] Blackpink
[00:14.98] 
[00:13.29] Kick in the door, waving the coco'
[00:16.35] 팝콘이나 챙겨 껴들 생각 말고
[00:18.94] I talk that talk, runways I walk-walk
[00:21.94] 눈 감고, pop-pop, 안 봐도 척
[00:32.44] 
[00:24.24] One by one, then two by two
[00:26.54] 내 손끝 툭 하나에 다 무너지는 중
[00:29.28] 가짜 쇼 치곤 화려했지
[00:31.64] Makes no sense, you couldn't get a dollar out of me
[00:57.14] 
[00:35.01] 자, 오늘 밤이야, 난 독을 품은 꽃
[00:40.68] 네 혼을 빼앗은 다음, look what you made us do
[00:45.62] 천천히 널 잠재울 fire
[00:50.12] 잔인할 만큼 아름다워 (I bring the pain like)
[01:07.62] 
[00:55.74] This that pink venom, this that pink venom
[00:58.56] This that pink venom (get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)

[01:16.99] Black paint and ammo', got bodies like Rambo
[01:19.50] Rest in peace, please, light up a candle
[01:21.51] This the life of a vandal, masked up, and I'm still in CELINE
[01:24.76] Designer crimes, or it wouldn't be me, ooh!
[01:27.33] Diamonds shining, drive in silence, I don't mind it, I'm riding
[01:30.46] Flying private side by side with the pilot up in the sky
[01:33.02] And I'm wyling, styling on them and there's no chance
[01:35.55] 'Cause we got bodies on bodies like this a slow dance
[02:02.05] 
[01:38.85] 자, 오늘 밤이야, 난 독을 품은 꽃
[01:44.68] 네 혼을 빼앗은 다음, look what you made us do

[02:07.31] Straight to ya dome like ah-ah-ah
[02:10.35] Taste that pink venom, taste that pink venom
[02:13.04] Taste that pink venom (get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)
[02:15.69] Straight to ya dome like whoa-whoa-whoa
[02:18.25] Straight to ya dome like ah-ah-ah
[02:34.75] 
[02:21.20] 원한다면 provoke us
[02:23.42] 감당 못해 and you know this
[02:26.48] 이미 퍼져버린 shot that potion
[02:28.53] 네 눈앞은 핑크빛 ocean
[02:31.58] Come and give me all the smoke
[02:33.26] 도 아니면 모 like I'm so rock and roll
[02:36.73] Come and give me all the smoke
[02:39.57] 다 줄 세워 봐, 자, stop, drop (I bring the pain like)
[03:03.07]
